# Fundamentals of Web Development, 2nd Edition
### Chapter 9 [JavaScript 2], Project 3 [Book CRM]

web page to visually identify the tag name of all elements on a page. Recursion as a
programming topic was not covered in this chapter, so this project is only suitable
for a programmer already familiar with the technique.
